How To Contribute
=================

Every open source project runs on the generous help by contributors that sacrifice their valuable time and effort.

Here are a few guidelines to get you started:

- Try to limit each pull request to one change only.
- Make sure your changes pass our CI.
- If your change is noteworthy, add an entry to the changelog_.
  Use present tense, semantic newlines, and add link to your pull request.
- No contribution is too small
- *Always* add tests and docs for your code.
  Pull requests with missing tests or documentation will not be merged.
- Write `good test docstrings`_.
- Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.
- If you address review feedback, make sure to bump the pull request.
  Maintainers don’t receive notifications if you push new commits.
